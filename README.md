# NYC-high-school-data-cleaning-and-analysis

New York City has published data on student SAT scores by high school, along with additional demographic data sets.

In this project, I have 
1. Cleaned, combined data from different sources, 
2. Investigated possible relationships between SAT scores and demographics
3. Discovered correlations, created plots, and made maps to anaylyse data.
